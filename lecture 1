1/How much of the data generated by IoT devices is actually used, and how much is wasted? Why is so much data ignored?
->According to a report by Cisco, only about 10% of IoT data is used, while the remaining 90% is ignored or unanalyzed. The main reasons include:
  -Massive data volume: IoT devices generate vast amounts of data, making it difficult to process and analyze everything.
  -High storage and processing costs: Storing and processing all data requires robust infrastructure and significant expenses.
  -Redundant or irrelevant data: Much of the IoT data may be repetitive or not provide valuable insights.

2/For each of the areas described below, find one concrete example that's not given in the text.
Here are concrete examples for each area that are not mentioned in the text:
 - Consumer IoT
  +Smart pet feeders: These devices allow pet owners to schedule and control feeding times remotely via a mobile app, ensuring pets are fed even when their owners are away.
 - Commercial IoT
  +Smart conference room booking systems: These use IoT sensors to detect room occupancy and integrate with scheduling software to optimize meeting space usage in offices.
 - Industrial IoT (IIoT)
  +Smart beehives: IoT-enabled hives monitor temperature, humidity, and hive activity to help beekeepers track colony health and prevent issues like colony collapse disorder.
 - Infrastructure IoT
  +Smart streetlights: These lights adjust brightness based on pedestrian and vehicle movement, reducing energy waste and improving nighttime safety.

3/ If you could add IoT devices to measure anything where you live, what would it be?
I would add air quality sensors for real-time pollution monitoring, smart water meters to track usage and detect leaks, and noise sensors to report excessive noise. Waste management sensors in trash bins could also improve collection efficiency. These IoT devices would make the community healthier and more sustainable.
