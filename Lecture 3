1/Do some research. What sensors does your phone have?
  - Motion Sensors: Accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer.
  - Environmental Sensors: Barometer, ambient light, proximity sensor.
  - Health Sensors: Heart rate, SpO2 (if supported).
  - Navigation Sensors: GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, Galileo.
  - Biometric & Optical: Fingerprint, IR blaster, TOF sensor.
  - Audio: Microphone, ultrasound (in some models).

2/What do you think happens if the sensor returns a higher voltage than was sent (for example coming from an external power supply)
- Damage to the Sensor or Microcontroller – If the voltage exceeds the input limits of the receiving circuit (e.g., ADC of a microcontroller), it could permanently damage the components.
- Incorrect Readings – The system might interpret the excess voltage as erroneous data, leading to faulty measurements.
- Protection Mechanisms Activate – Many circuits include clamping diodes (e.g., Zener diodes, TVS diodes) to protect against overvoltage, which might prevent damage but could cause heating or failure if prolonged.
- Power Feedback Issues – If the sensor is on a shared bus (e.g., I2C, SPI), it might interfere with other devices by unintentionally supplying power back into the circuit.
- Voltage Regulator Failure – If the sensor relies on a regulated voltage supply, excess voltage might bypass or overload the regulator, affecting other components.

3/ Do some research. What actuators does your phone have?
- Vibration: LRA/ERM motor for haptics.
- Audio: Speakers, earpiece, noise-canceling mic.
- Display: OLED/LCD pixels, refresh rate control.
- Camera: Autofocus motor, OIS, aperture control.
- Biometrics: Fingerprint scanner, Face ID projector.
- Connectivity: Taptic Engine (Apple), 5G mmWave antenna.

4/What do you think happens if the IoT device sends a higher voltage than the actuator can handle?
-Damage to the Actuator
-Unexpected Behavior
-Short Circuit or System Failure
-Protection Circuit Activation
